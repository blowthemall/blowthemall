# BlowThemAll

## ABOUT

It's a bomberman-like game, not a bomberman clone, because we intend to
implement some original ideas.

It's multiplayer oriented because we want to deliver a unique online gaming
experience, with fully customized characters, interactive maps, among others.

It's bomberman because we love bomberman and we are developers, so we can make
the best bomberman-like game.
